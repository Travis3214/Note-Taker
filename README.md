  ## Description
  This is a note taker app. The purpose of this app is to deploy a website to Heroku that allows us to make, save, and delete notes. After typing in a title and note you can press the save button on the top right corner of the page to save it. You can then come back later and you will still have your note. Once ready to delete, you can press the trash icon on the note to delete it!
